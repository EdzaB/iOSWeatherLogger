# iOSWeatherLogger

This project is a really quick iOS app, that takes weather API data and displays them on screen for the users current location.
The user then has the ability to save the data to local storage using CoreData

The App consists of two screens - a table screen and a details screen.

Within the details screen there is a small animation that displays every time its opened.
